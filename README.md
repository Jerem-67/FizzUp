      DB_PORT=3306
      DB_DATABASE=_databaseName_
      DB_USERNAME=_user_
      DB_PASSWORD=_password_

    Change _user_, _password_ and _databaseName_ with your mysql credentials
    Please double check your port and your localServer address for the BDD.

2. Run `npm run dev` to compile all scss file 
and create all builds needed.

2. Configure `.env` in the same way as dev environment [â†‘](#if-you-want-to-make-some-changes-in-dev-environment-).
