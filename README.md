## Build With

- [PHP 7.4](https://www.php.net/)
- [Laravel](https://laravel.com/)

## Configuration

All you need to run this app on your server.

When you have cloned this app, you have to run a `composer install` 
> Take a coffee 

Then you have to run:
`yarn install`,
`npm install`
> Take a second coffee 

This two past command will download all the packages 
you need to run the app on your server.
There are all available in `composer.json` and in `yarn.lock`.

Then you have to configure your `.env` :

### **If you want to make some changes in dev environment :** 

1. You have to create a `.env.local` (Copy/Past `.env). 
    > DATABASE_URL=mysql://_user_:_password_@127.0.0.1:3306/prosoon

    Change _user_ and _password_ with your mysql credentials
    Please double check your port and your localServer address for the BDD.

2. Run `yarn encore dev` to compile all scss file 
and create all builds needed.

If you have some node error please download node on your computer (https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

### **If you want to deploy on your server :**

If you use your own script for deployment please go on next topic.<br>
Else: 

1. Clone master on your server.

2. Configure `.env` in the same way as dev environment [â†‘](#if-you-want-to-make-some-changes-in-dev-environment-).

3. Run `composer install` `yarn install`  and then run `yarn encore prod`.

4. Run `APP_ENV=prod APP_DEBUG=0 php bin/console cache:clear`
To convert the app from dev in prod.

5. Run `yarn encore prod`.
